Hi, I’m Yunfan ZHANG. Now I am an EEE student studying at Duke University.
I am very interested in software engineering and computer science and currently, I have created my Github account.
It is very happy to get in touch with many outstanding programmers here and I really wish I could have some communication here.

My email is yz845@duke.edu. Please feel free to contact me!
I will try to upload the project after we have learned something in the collage.
